# about
This is my final exam project for my MBO school. This project has been made for a fictional driving school as a means to automate the process and remove paperwork. For this exam, I was tasked with creating the Instructor part of a larger project that would later be put together with two other students. In this repository you will find my part of the exam; "Instructor".

# installation

### software requirements:
- npm (8.19.2)

- local server (for database)

To run this project in development mode you must first clone the github repo: 

`https://github.com/Lucas010603/DriveSmart`

Now you can configure your database by configuring the .env

to install the required packages for both the front and backend you can run the following commands:

to seed the database you can run the following command
